I write code and test code [insert whatever job titles you think this means] and sometimes even play around with numbers.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning R and how to use it for stats related to baseball and hockey.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on displaying data with R.
- ðŸ¦œ I have given talks on a variety of software testing topics as well as data analysis of large data groups.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Blazor app to display my hockey score-keeping schedule and check for validity.
